Python API Client
=================

_note_ this project is _not_ actively maintained but contributions _are_ welcome.

See [Meetup API Clients][1] for details.

To get a list of groups- based on keyword, zip code, and radius- to either print in the console or be exported to an excel file, run `setup.py`, and once a config file is created, run `findGroups.py`
